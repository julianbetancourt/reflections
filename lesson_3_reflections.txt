When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  	When collaborating with people in a same project or maybe if I want to share the project's code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because I can be aware of when a pull is made and that way I know what my local repository look like

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork: Will clone someone else's repository from his github repository to my github account. Use when I want to stor my
	own version of someone else's project.
	Clone: Will clone an existing project from a local machine or from the cloud (e.g via github) to my local machine. Use
	when I want to have in my local machine a given project.
	Branch: New "line" of work that helps mantaining the repository more organized.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	If I'm going to working offline I can update my local copy before going offline.
